## Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege Aim Assist — Steady Hands in a Shaking World

In **Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege**, victory is rarely loud. It arrives quietly—between heartbeats—when crosshair meets certainty. This **Rainbow Six Siege Aim Assist** is built for those moments, when pressure narrows vision and one mistake erases a round.

It does not steal aim.

## 🎯 Philosophy — Assistance, Not Automation

Siege punishes excess. Snap aiming, robotic movement, unnatural turns—they are all betrayals. This aim assist respects the game’s rhythm, offering **subtle correction and smooth guidance** that feels like refined muscle memory rather than a machine’s hand.

You still lead the motion.
The tool simply steadies the arc.

## 👁 Aim Logic & Targeting Behavior

Every calculation exists to remain invisible.

* Adjustable FOV radius for micro-corrections
* Bone selection (head, upper torso, adaptive)
* Distance-based strength scaling
* Visibility & line-of-sight checks

Targets are guided *into* alignment—never snapped.
